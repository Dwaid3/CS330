# CS330
I approach designing and developing my program by ensuring that I was checking all the necessary boxes.
This was important because OpenGl can be hard to pinpoint your errors when you are first starting to learn.
Overall this class gave me knowledge of a very powerful API and this will help further my educational pathway
because I love video game and maybe now that I have a grasp of this new tool I can use it to help with that.
Professionally I believe that this will help me because I have improved my skills overall for coding, and this
is by far the most valuable part of learning to utilize OpenGL.
